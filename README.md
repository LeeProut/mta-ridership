# MTA Transit Riders Flee the System While Cars Pack the Roads

#### January 2022 Storytelling with Data Challenge: [Visualizing Cycles](https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges/jan-2022-visualizing-cycles)

My weekday commute to my office in Manhattan used to be a regular cycle. But in mid-March 2020, I went from riding the subway five days a week to going months without riding it at all. I knew that subway ridership has failed to return to pre-pandemic norms, but I was curious about how subways, buses, and car traffic compared in the first year of the pandemic in NYC. I knew the drop-off in mid-March would be visually apparent, but I wasn't sure how things unfolded from there.

I wanted this to be a zoomed-out view, with the datapoints for the entire year giving a shape that could be compared among the three modes of transport. I decided to label only a few notable points on each chart, some highs and lows. I added a few headlines from the New York Times to emphasize story.

Since a radial chart would be new for me in any tool, I challenged myself to create visuals in Python. I found a [tutorial by Yan Holtz](https://python-graph-gallery.com/circular-barplot-basic) for creating a circular barplot in Matplotlib. You can view my jupyter [notebook](https://github.com/LeeProut/mta-ridership/blob/main/MTA_ridership_01-03-22.ipynb), with data exploration. 

I used the circular barplots to compare each mode of transport in a PowerPoint slide with annotations for my challenge submission.
